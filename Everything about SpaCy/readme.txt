## Introduction
In this repository, you will learn all you need to learn about spaCy, NER(Named Entity Recognition), and its implementation with Python. We will talk about the building blocks of spaCy 3 and RULE-BASED SpaCy in detail. After completing this, you will have all the theoretical and practical knowledge about spaCy and be able to design your own custom NER in spaCy 3, and you will have an understanding of pipes and pipelines in general, as well as the ones provided by spaCy specifically.
